# Bookbot

## Description
This project reads text from a file and analyzes the frequency of each alphabet character. It sorts characters alphabetically and produces a tidy report showing how many times each character appears.

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Create a books/ directory in your project folder and ensure it contains the frankenstein.txt file. This text can be sourced from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).

## Usage

To run the character frequency analysis, execute:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Features

* Counts the frequency of each alphabet character in a text file.
* Generates an easy-to-read report sorted alphabetically by character.
* Excludes non-alphabetic characters from the final report.

## Example Output

```
--- Begin report ---
The 'a' character was found 26743 times
The 'b' character was found 5026 times
The 'c' character was found 9243 times
...
--- End report ---
```
